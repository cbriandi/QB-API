# QB API
This is a test API that I push to render.

The API can be found at https://qb-api-vkad.onrender.com/api/players <br />
You can get data on a single player at https://qb-api-vkad.onrender.com/api/players/[player name] 


Since it was deployed on render, it can take up to a minute for the server to boot up.
